# Arxiv Harverster

This program is dedicated to automatically harvesting the Arxiv.org website for new and recent papers and filtering them out by the relevant key words.
## Arxiv-Harvester

Check out which website you would like to visit.
Then, save the response of your request in the file.
After opening the file, you can work with it locally as you wish.
It would be useful to use regular expressions, as the website response is
a text file.

Run as
|| python ArxivHarvester.py
